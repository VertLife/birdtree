		This tool provides a simple way to produce distributions of trees with subsets of taxa. The upper limit for the tool is 2,500 species (above which server-based subsetting becomes prohibitively slow). If larger subsets are required you can <a href="archives/">download full trees</a> by following the links on the left.
		<br><br>
		The tool first trims to a subset, and then samples trees from a chosen pseudo-posterior distribution. <i>Note that any further analyses should only be conducted with a large sample of trees.</i>

	    <b>Instructions</b>
	    <br>
	    1. Select species from the list. Then copy and paste or drag and drop them into the box to the right. Alternatively, download the <a href="BLIOCPhyloMasterTax.csv"> taxonomy file</a> and paste species names from the "Scientific" column.
	    <br>
	    2. Choose a tree distribution (see paper for details).
	    <br>
	    3. Select the number of trees to download (defaults to minimum of 100)
	    <br>
	    4. Click "Get Trees" to download a zipped set of randomly selected trees with metadata including accession numbers and citations to original sources.
