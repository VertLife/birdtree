Phylogeny subsets
=================

This tool provides a simple way to produce distributions of trees with subsets
of taxa. The upper limit for the tool is 2,500 species. If larger subsets ar
required you can [download full trees](http://birdtree.org/archives/).

The tool first trims to a subset, and then samples trees from a chosen
pseudo-posterior distribution. *Note that any further analyses should only
be conducted with a large sample of trees.*

**Instructions**
<div class="well">
1. Select species from the list. Then copy and paste or drag and drop
them into the box to the right.  
Alternatively, download the [taxonomy file](http://birdtree.org/bird-tree/BLIOCPhyloMasterTax.csv)
and paste species names from the "Scientific" column.  
2. Choose a tree distribution (see paper for details).  
3. Select the number of trees to download (defaults to minimum of 100)  
4. Click "Get Trees" to download a zipped set of randomly selected
trees with metadata including accession numbers and citations to original  
sources.
