<p>The phylogeny is available to download as either archives of complete trees (below) or by subsetting to a user provided set of species using the tool on the right.</p>

<p>There are four choices of class-wide tree distribution to choose from, each containing 10K trees, stored as zip archives of 1K trees each. Full details of each tree distribution are available in the supplementary material.</p>
